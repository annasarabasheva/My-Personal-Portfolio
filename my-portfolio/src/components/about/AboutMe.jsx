        <p>
         For the past two and a half years, I've been diving deep into coding and web development. Before that, I was studying Economics in Germany, where I earned my Bachelor's Degree.

          I know these two fields don't have much in common, but my introduction to programming happened unexpectedly during my fifth semester. It was supposed to be my semester abroad, but due to COVID, we ended up taking data analysis courses that included Python, R, and a bit of machine learning. I was initially intimidated, convinced I wouldn't manage. But to my surprise, I discovered that coding was exactly what I wanted to do.

          Fast forward to today, after completing several Python courses, I'm fully immersed in this field. I know it's tough and competitive, but working on projects, solving problems, and building things from scratch genuinely makes me happy â€” and that's why I'm here.
